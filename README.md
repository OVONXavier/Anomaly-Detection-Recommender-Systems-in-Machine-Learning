# Anomaly-Detection-Recommender-Systems-in-Machine-Learning
This project implements an integrated approach to detect anomalies and provide intelligent recommendations using machine learning techniques in Python. 

The notebook demonstrates real-world applications such as fraud detection and content recommendation systems.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor
- Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering
- Evaluation of models using various performance metrics
- Integrated notebook flow for reproducibility


## 🌐 Real-World Applications

### Anomaly Detection

Financial and operational use cases where early detection of outliers saves time and money:

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
   Real-time transaction scoring to flag suspicious behavior based on transaction history and geolocation.  

2. **Network Intrusion Detection**  
   Monitoring network traffic patterns to block DDoS attacks and unauthorized access.

3. **Predictive Maintenance**  
   Sensor data analysis (vibration, temperature) to forecast equipment failures and plan timely repairs.

4. **Healthcare Monitoring**  
   Early warning systems for patient vitals (ECG, BP) to alert medical staff to critical events.

### Recommender Systems

Personalization engines in e-commerce and streaming:

1. **Netflix-Style Recommendations**  
   Combining user watch history and item similarity to suggest shows and movies.

2. **Amazon “Customers Also Bought”**  
   Item-to-item collaborative filtering at scale for cross-selling in shopping carts.

3. **Music & Content Platforms**  
   Hybrid models blending collaborative filtering with content-based features for tailored playlists.

4. **News & E-Learning**  
   Adaptive content delivery based on reading history and course progress.
